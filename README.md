# The day I asked ChatGPT to teach me Python. 

One day not too long after I graduated school and had spent the morning studying, I was using ChatGPT to help clairify things, my prompts were along the lines of "Explain this to me like I am a child." It was doing a really good job and I was acutally retaining the information. Once I felt studied out I decided to put this prompt into ChatGPT: 

Can you teach me python i am a beginner and want to break into the IT industry and have no money can you help me?

And oh the adventure it took me on. Now I am goind to take you on the same adventure. 

# Tools
- Python
- Linux

# Methodology

1. The first thing I did was set up my environment. I already had a VM with Linux set up on my main Windows machine. I downloaded Python onto my VM and also downloaded VS code.
2. Once I was in my terminal I used the commmand mkdir python101
3. I got the directory made and now I was ready to start writing some scripts. I started out with some really simple scripts such as:

These were fun and simple and it helped me begin to understand how Python works.

4. Then ChatGPT gave me a script that was about data types

I'll admit when I wrote this I tried to run it and nothing happened. Then when I asked ChatGPT to help me trouble shoot that is when I learned about **Data Types** and **Variables.** Data Types is the information that a variable can hold. If Python were a storage room full of boxes. Some hold words, or True/False flags, a list of things or labeled information. The types tells Python what is inside those boxes and how it should behave. A variable is a a name you give to a piece of information. It's like writing something on a sticky note then sticking it to your desk so you can look at it whenever you need to.
