# The day I asked ChatGPT to teach me Python. 

One day not too long after I graduated school and had spent the morning studying, I was using ChatGPT to help clairify things, my prompts were along the lines of "Explain this to me like I am a child." It was doing a really good job and I was acutally retaining the information. Once I felt studied out I decided to put this prompt into ChatGPT: 

Can you teach me python i am a beginner and want to break into the IT industry and have no money can you help me?

And oh the adventure it took me on. Now I am goind to take you on the same adventure.
